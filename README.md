# TechQuizzer Application

## Description
Our project is a computer science quiz game app
designed to test users' knowledge through multiple-choice questions.
It provides an exciting and interactive experience where users can challenge themselves
and improve their understanding of various computer science topics.
This project was assigned to me during my internship at CodSoft,
a renowned software development company.

The app offers a diverse range of questions covering different areas of computer science,
including programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and more.
Users can select their answers from the provided options and submit their choices.
One of the key features of the app is the immediate feedback it provides.
After submitting an answer, users receive instant feedback indicating
whether their response was correct or incorrect.

This prompt feedback enables users to evaluate their understanding of the topic
and learn from any mistakes made. In addition to the quiz functionality,
the app includes features such as score tracking, time limits.
Users can keep track of their scores over time, challenge themselves to
improve their accuracy and speed, and monitor their progress as they advance through the quizzes.

I had the opportunity to work on this project as part of my internship at CODSOFT,
where I gained hands-on experience in developing a real-world application.
It was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply my computer science knowledge
and skills to create an engaging educational app.

Overall, this computer science quiz game app serves as a valuable tool for
individuals at any level of computer science expertise, from beginners seeking
to learn more to experienced professionals looking to test their knowledge.
